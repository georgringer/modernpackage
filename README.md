# Theme modern package

This is a "ready to go" theme with best practise code from all TYPO3 websites I have done and coached.

## Quickstart
For a quick start, do the following

#### 1. Download
in your shell:
`$ curl https://raw.github.com/georgringer/modernpackage/master/start.sh > start.sh && start.sh ./typo3conf/ext/theme_anyname`

This will download the file https://github.com/georgringer/modernpackage/blob/master/start.sh and create a new extension based on the name "theme_anyname".


#### 2. Install the extension
Install the extension "theme_anyname".
